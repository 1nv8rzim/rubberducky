- How does a rubber ducky work?
    """
    The Rubber Ducky uses keystroke injection technology to run malicious code 
    quickly and easily on a device—serving as an unsuspecting way to steal 
    passwords, drop malware, install “backdoors” into systems, exfiltrate data, 
    and more. Attackers can leverage USB attacks by leaving USB drives behind 
    and waiting for users to pick them up, sending them to their targets, 
    or by entering a physical establishment, using social engineering tactics 
    to gain access, and then plug the drives into systems themselves.

    - Explain in detail to your boss (low level/technical)
    A Rubber Ducky is a hacking tool (normaly disquised as a usb drive)
    that is able to keystroke injection onto a computer upon insertion. This
    allows preplanned attacks to be executed via pre-written out scripts 
    that are fastly and automatically typed into the victim computer with the
    physical connection being unable to be differentiated from manual input 
    via user.

    - Explain it to your mom or high schooler (high level)
    A Rubber Ducky is a hacking tool that will normally look like a usb,
    however when plugged in will run a program that can compromise what it is
    plugged into. Rubber Ducky's work almost like keyboard and use 'keystroke
    injection' where it impersonates a keyboard and sends keystrokes to the
    computer as if it was you typing on your computer. This means that anything
    that can be done if the hacker had keyboard access to your computer can be 
    done by an automated script.
